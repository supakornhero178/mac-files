# Welcome to my mac files repository!

I keep some of my macintosh work here. Check it out!

I have some useful mac files in my `Useful Files` folder, and my school work in my `School Work` folder.

In my `Useful files` folder, I keep some useful files, images, some random art I made in my free time, and some of my school work too.

In my `School Work` folder, I keep most of my school work.

Enjoy looking through my arts made in my Macintosh project!
