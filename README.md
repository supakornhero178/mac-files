# Welcome to my mac files repository!

I keep some of my macintosh work here. Check it out!

I have three folders :
1. `Useful files`
2. `School work`
3. `Chinese Interactive`

In my `Useful files` folder, I keep some useful files, images, some random art I made in my free time, and some of my school work too.

In my `School Work` folder, I keep most of my school work.

In my `Chinese Interactive` folder, I keep my chinese interactive keynote presentation files, with random Chinese characters.

Enjoy looking through my arts made in my Macintosh project!
